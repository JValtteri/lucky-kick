## How to play ##

To throw the disk, **click and drag** anywhere on the field and pull away from the disk. Further you pull from the disk, the harder the throw.

You can adjust the angle in which you throw with arrow keys (Left and Right). All throws are modelled as right hand, back hand throws (or left hand fore hand throws), where the disk rotates clockwise.

The disk will tend to *fade* to the left. The harde

Throwing through tree branches slows the disk, and hitting the trunk will make the disk bounce off or *kick* off of the trunk.

After each lane, you will a summary of the throws so far. Press **space** or **enter** to continue to the next lane.

## Bugs ##

**There are bugs**. The game is in its early ***BETA*** testing. All bugs are handled through ***issues*** and my head. 

Feel free to post your findigs *in great details* in the ***Issues*** tab.

**The Editor** is definately a ***at-your-own-risk*** kind of deal. It mostly does what is neaded, but all the latest fixes aren't in the *master* branch. I'll get there. I need *The Editor* more than you do, believe me!
